        "*   This project **\"Vaccination Data Analysis and Visualization\"** aims to analyze global vaccination data to understand trends in vaccination coverage, disease incidence, and the effectiveness of vaccination programs. The project utilizes a three-step approach: data cleaning, setting up a SQL database, and creating interactive dashboards in Power BI.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   The initial phase involves cleaning the data by handling missing values, normalizing units, and ensuring date consistency across datasets. The cleaned data is then stored in a SQL database, which is structured into separate tables to avoid redundancy and improve querying performance. The database will have primary and foreign keys to ensure data integrity.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   Finally, Power BI will be used to connect to the SQL database and create dynamic and visually engaging reports. These reports will feature key visualizations like geographical heatmaps to display coverage by region, trend lines to show changes over time, and scatter plots to correlate vaccination coverage with disease incidence. The project seeks to answer questions related to vaccine effectiveness, regional disparities, and the impact of vaccination campaigns. The ultimate goal is to provide data-driven recommendations for public health policy, resource allocation, and disease prevention strategies."
